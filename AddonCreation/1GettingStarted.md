## Setting up the workspace
1. Before you create an add-on you must already know how to make a minecraft mod. This tutorial will NOT cover the basics of creating mods, it will only cover how to use ZAWA.
2. Download the latest ZAWA and latest Bookworm developer files from their curse pages. [ZAWA](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zoo-wild-animals-rebuild) and [Bookworm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bookworm)
3. Add the two mods to your libs folder like you would for any other dependency.
